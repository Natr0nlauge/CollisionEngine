# 2D Collision Engine using SFML

&#x20;&#x20;

## A simple engine for simulating 2D rigid body movement and collisions. My contribution for the masters' course "Efficient Programming", winter semester 2024/2025.

- **Real-time rigid body Simulation** with customizable geometry and physical properties
- **Collision detection** enabling collisions of convex polygons and circles using SAT
- **Collision resolution** simulating interactions between bodies
- **Process user inputs** to control body movements

Uses the library [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for managing the Simulation window and rendering.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio (2022 or later)**
- **C++14 or later**

### Cloning and Building in Visual Studio

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Open the Visual Studio solution**
   - Open `CollisionEngine.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. **Set up SFML**
   - Configure SFML include and library directories in project properties.
4. **Build and Run**
   - Select **Debug** or **Release** mode.
   - Click **Build** â†’ **Build Solution**.
   - Run the project!

## Usage

Please find the main.cpp in the provided repository for a simple example program.

When running the example program, WASD can be used to control the player body. The body can be "teleported" by using the left mouse button.
